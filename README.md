Aural
===

Aural is an ambient noise generator inspired by [A Soft Murmur](http://asoftmurmur.com/). It allows you to
play sounds and adjust the volumes of various background noises to mimic the environment they want to be in.

A [study](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/665048) from the University of Chicago discovered that appropriate ambient noise improved productivity and concentration.
This has led to the increased popularity of generators like Aural, [Coffitivity](https://coffitivity.com/#research), and [Noisli](http://www.noisli.com/). Aural does
have some soothing sounds, but it also has harsher noises, making it more appropriate as an experience simulator rather than as a relaxation or productivity aide.

The [live version](http://aural.jgefroh.com) can be found on my website.

### Technologies
Front-end
- AngularJS


#### Did you know?
`.mp3` files have silence added to the beginning and end of the file by the encoding/decoding process. This makes it difficult to achieve gapless playback or proper loops - not good when you're trying to create a seamless auditory experience!
